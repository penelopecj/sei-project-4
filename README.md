## Deployment
I deployed this website using Heroku and it is available [_here_](http://piekea.herokuapp.com/). The free servers on Heroku sleep when they are not it use, so please allow a minute or two for them to wake up! ðŸ˜´

Feel free to register your own account, or you can use mine `penny@email.com` and password `pass`.

## Concept
**PIEKEA** has some similarities to the popular Swedish furniture store, [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/). Both stores include a robust e-commerce platform and the option to build and customise the products. However, while IKEA sells a wide variety of home and outdoor furniture, PIEKEA sells a delicious selection of freshly baked pies to be eaten at home or in the outdoors. A variety of sweet and savoury pies available, while supplies last.

N.B.: There are no actual pies involved.

## Project Brief
* One week to plan, build, and test our final project with a focus on cementing the learning from the past 11 weeks and showing off our new Python skills.
* Choose to work solo, as a pair, or as a group for the duration of the project.
* Review project proposal with our instructor so we can make sure it can be accomplished in the limited time we have.
* Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and front-end.
* Use a Python Django API, using Django REST Framework to serve our data from a Postgres database.
* Consume our API with a separate frontend built with React.
* Build a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help us know which features are core MVP and which can be cut.
* Have a visually impressive design and be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
* A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.

## User Stories & Wireframes

**Database Entity Relationship Diagram**

**Wireframe**
![Wireframe](./client/src/images/wireframe.png)
## General Approach & Planning
* My partner and I began by mocking up a basic wireframe and plan for the app on a Google Doc (above).
* We next created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for our database tables and relationships (above).
* We tried not to get caught up in too many awesome features and to keep the project fairly simple. 
* We decided to build an e-commerce site that could handle unlimited user accounts and keeping track of the products in their baskets. That was our core MVP - we only added in additional features once we realised we were running ahead of schedule.
* We focussed on the design first, beginning by planning our user stories and wireframes before writing any code.
* We set up a Trello board for project management and task delegation.

![trello board](./client/src/images/trello.png)

* We followed an Agile system for starting each day with a standup meeting for the two of us, followed by a standup for the group leaders of each group on the course.
* We split up all of our tasks into the first MVP sprint or the second optional extras sprint. We used Trello to track who was working on what and to let each other know when we had finished a task or needed help.
* I used Trello and Slack to write pseudocode to think through the logic and steps of the more complicated features.
* By this point on the General Assembly course, I felt quite confident about my pair-coding, communication, and project management systems. This allowed us to get started writing actual code very quickly on the first day.
* I used Slack and frequent commits to let my partner know what I was working on and what I had pushed to our shared git development branch.

### DAYS 1 & 2
* We started out by scaffolding the backend, adding the PostgresSQL database, writing seeds data, and installing dependencies. All of this went surprisingly smoothly, which showed us we had come a long way from our first projects.
* Using Django, I set up the "apps" for pies, users, reviews, categories, and basket items. These are quite quick to do with Django, so I had time to write the models, urls, and views for all of these.

**Pie Model**
```
class Pie(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    description = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    image = models.CharField(max_length=300)
    price = models.FloatField()
    categories = models.ManyToManyField('categories.Category', related_name='pies')

    def __str__(self):
            return f"{self.name} - Â£{self.price}"
```

* Next I began writing serializers for each app only as needed, and adding additional RESTful routes and serializers as I went along.

```
from jwt_auth.serializers.common import UserSerializer
from pies.serializers.populated import PopulatedPieSerializer
from ..serializers.common import BasketSerializer

class PopulatedBasketSerializer(BasketSerializer):
    owner = UserSerializer()
    product = PopulatedPieSerializer()
```

* I migrated each new app as I made changes and let my partner know to do the same.
* I tested each new RESTful route I added to the models using Insomnia as well as Django's built in admin page.

**POST request on Insomnia**

![insomnia request](./client/src/images/user-login-request.png)

**Manage pies on Django admin**

![pies on django admin](./client/src/images/django-admin-pies.png)

* We spent the evenings writing out seeds data, which I then converted to JSON in the mornings and re-seeded into the working backend.
* I also checked that the database was set up and seeded correctly with TablePlus.

![TablePlus display of reviews database](./client/src/images/tableplus.png)

* Once all was working, I complicated the relationships as shown in our ERD and added a many-to-many relationship between our users and products, to use later as the 'favourite' feature.
```
favourites = models.ManyToManyField('pies.Pie', related_name='users', blank=True)
```
* I also added a many-to-many relationship between the pies and the categories that we could use later to filter the pies by category and list the descriptor words for each pie product.
```
categories = models.ManyToManyField('categories.Category', related_name='pies')
```
* I then adapted the basket items GET request on the backend that would ensure the user only sees the items in the user's own basket. Similarly, I added a check that will PUT an item the user wants to purchase in that user's own basket.

**Basket Items Views**
```
class BasketListView(APIView):
    """ Controller for get and post request to /basket endpoint """

    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated, )

    def get(self, _request):
        basket_items = Basket_Item.objects.filter(owner=self.request.user)
        serialized_items = PopulatedBasketSerializer(basket_items, many=True)
        return Response(serialized_items.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    def post(self, request):
        request.data["owner"] = request.user.id
        basket = BasketSerializer(data=request.data)
        if basket.is_valid():
            basket.save()
            return Response(basket.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(basket.errors, status=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)

class BasketDetailView(APIView):
    """ Controller for delete and edit requests to /basket_item/id(pk) endpoint """

    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated, )

    def delete(self, request, pk):
        try:
            basket_to_delete = Basket_Item.objects.get(pk=pk)
            if basket_to_delete.owner.id != request.user.id:
                raise PermissionDenied()
            basket_to_delete.delete()
            return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
        except Basket_Item.DoesNotExist:
            raise NotFound()

    def put(self, request, pk):
        basket_to_update = Basket_Item.objects.get(pk=pk)
        if basket_to_update.owner.id != request.user.id:
            print(basket_to_update.owner.id)
            print(request.user.id)
            raise PermissionDenied()
        updated_basket = BasketQuantitySerializer(basket_to_update, data=request.data)
        if updated_basket.is_valid():
            updated_basket.save()
            return Response(updated_basket.data, status=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED)
        return Response(updated_basket.errors, status=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
```

* We wrote out and tested our error handling for all of the basic RESTful routes and finished building our backend after just _two_ days. Thank you, Django!

![Django slogan](./client/src/images/django-logo.png)



## DAYS 3 & 4
* We were running ahead of schedule, so we took some time to re-evaluate our MVP and add in additional features from our wish list to the current sprint.
* We added a React front end to our project and divided up the router and component setup.
* My partner preferred to style using Semantic UI and I preferred to style using SASS, so we installed both on our project to use.
* We opted to use Axios for REST front end side as it makes it easier to edit and delete items from the database.
* I built the nav bar with flexbox and Material Icons.

![nav bar](./client/src/images/small-nav.png)

* Wrote the GET and POST requests to display the basic info about the pies on a "show all" index page, display more detail about indivdual products on the show page if you click on one, and create a new pie with the customise feature.

![All Pies page](./client/src/images/index.png)

```
export function getAllPies() {
  return axios.get(`${baseUrl}/pies/`)
}

export function createPie(formdata) {
  return axios.post(`${baseUrl}/pies/`, formdata, headers())
}

export function getSinglePie(id) {
  return axios.get(`${baseUrl}/pies/${id}/`)
}
```

![Apple pie page](./client/src/images/show-apple-pie.png)

* Next, I built a **â™¡** button and separate wish list component. This required going back to the backend to write a special serializer for the users that would only require the `favourites: []` array to get updated on a given user object in the database.

```
class FavouritesUserSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ("favourites", )
```

![Wish List page](./client/src/images/wish-list.png)

**Function for â™¡ Button**
```
const handleAddToWishlist = async () => {
  const favIds = user.favourites.map(fav => {
    return fav.id
  })
  await editUser(payload.sub, { favourites: [ ...favIds, pie.id ] })
}
```

**JSX Code for Wish List**
```
{user.favourites.map(fav => {
  return (
    <li key={fav.id} className="box">
      <Link to={`pies/${fav.id}`} className="flex-box space-between">
        <figure>
          <img src={fav.image} alt={fav.name} />
        </figure>
        <div>
          <h3>{fav.name}</h3>
          <h4>Â£{fav.price.toFixed(2)}</h4>
          <p>{fav.description}</p>
        </div>
      </Link>
    </li>
  )
})}
```

## DAYS 5 & 6
* I preferred to style as I went along to ensure we would not run out of time for CSS at the end of the week. Especially for a clone site, I wanted to make sure it looked a lot like IKEA.

![Day 4 slack chat](./client/src/images/day4.png)

* I was very happy with how my styling for the basket page turned out, much like the IKEA basket.

**PIEKEA Basket (COPY)**

**IKEA Basket (ORIGINAL)**
![IKEA basket page](./client/src/images/ikea-basket1.png)
![IKEA basket page](./client/src/images/ikea-basket2.png)


* I used simple CSS and Google fonts to make text that looked like the IKEA logo.

![PIEKEA Logo](./client/src/images/pikea-logo-nav.png)

* I added a simple function to the pie product page to add to basket, which imports a function to use `axios.post`.
```
const handleAddToBasket = async () => {
  try {
    await createBasketItem({
      quantity: 1,
      product: id
    })
    history.push('/basket')
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```

* I added a function to delete a pie from the basket, which imports a function to use `axios.delete`.
```
const handleRemoveFromBasket = async (event) => {
  try {
    await deleteBasketItem(event.target.id)
    const { data } = await getAllBasketItems()
    setBasketItems(data) 
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```

* I built a display for the reviews with photos, names, timestamp, and star rating. If a user does not have a profile photo, it will display an anonymous photo as a placeholder. Only the user who left the review can delete the review.

![apple pie reviews](./client/src/images/reviews.png)

## FINAL DAY

![Final slack chat](./client/src/images/day7.png)

* We had just enough time at the end of the week to add some IKEA-esque fonts to the site and include sÃ¶me Swedish letters in the heÃ¥ders and seeds dÃ¤ta (in homage to IKEA's hÃ¶melÃ¥nd).
* I suddenly realised we didn't have a **Logout** button 30 minutes before the presentation and built one in very quickly right before we presented our project. What a rush!


## WINS
* My partner and I worked hard to get only the quantity of one pie basket item to update using a number input in a mapped JSX element.
```
{basketItems.map((item, index) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex-box basket-item" key={item.id}>
      <figure>
        <img src={item.product.image} alt={item.product.name} />
      </figure>
      <div>
        <h3>{item.product.name}</h3>
        <p><strong>Â£{item.product.price.toFixed(2)}</strong></p>
        {item.product.categories.length > 0 ?
          <ul>
            {item.product.categories.map(category => {
              return (
                <li key={category.id}>{category.name}</li>
              )
            })}
          </ul>
          :
          <ul></ul>
        }
        <div className="change-quantity">
          <p>Quantity: </p>
          <input 
            placeholder={item.quantity}
            onChange={handleChange} 
            id={index} 
            name="quantity" 
            type="number" 
            max="15"
            min="1"
            value={formdata.quantity} 
          />
          <button 
            onClick={handleEditFromBasket} 
            id={item.id} 
            className={index} 
          >Update item</button>
        </div>
        <p onClick={handleRemoveFromBasket} id={item.id} className="remove-add-btn">Remove</p>
        <p onClick={handleAddToWishlist} id={item.product.id}className="remove-add-btn">Add to your wish list</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
})
}
```

* We updated the numbers in state first.
```
function useEditQuantityForm(initialState) {
  const [formdata, setFormdata] = React.useState(initialState)
  const [errors, setErrors] = React.useState(initialState)

  const handleChange = event => {
    const value = event.target.type === 'checkbox' ? event.target.checked : event.target.value

    const editingArray = [...formdata]
    editingArray[event.target.id].quantity = value

    const nextErrorState = { ...errors, [event.target.name]: '' }

    setFormdata(editingArray)
    setErrors(nextErrorState)
  }
```

Then sent the PUT request to the database when the user clicks on "**Update item**".

```
const handleEditFromBasket = async (event) => {
  try {
    await updateBasketItem(event.target.id, formdata[parseInt(event.target.className)]) 
    const { data } = await getAllBasketItems()
    setBasketItems(data)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```
* I added an array method in the JSX to show the total cost of the items in the basket, accounting for quantities. I thought it would be more difficult, but this was incredibly easy to add with JavaScript.

```
<p className="total">Â£{basketItems.reduce((acc, curr) => {
  return acc + (curr.product.price * curr.quantity)
}, 0).toFixed(2)}
</p>
```

* I used a custom React hook to handle the form state manipulation and checkboxes on the customise pie form. Used an object spread to create a new object every time, triggering the React state to change and the browser to re-render.

```
function useCheckboxForm(initialState) {
  const [formdata, setFormdata] = React.useState(initialState)
  const [errors, setErrors] = React.useState(initialState)

  const handleChange = event => {
    const value = event.target.type === 'checkbox' ? JSON.parse(event.target.value) : event.target.value

    const nextState = { ...formdata, categories: [...formdata.categories, value] }
    const nextErrorState = { ...errors, [event.target.name]: '' }
    
    setFormdata(nextState)
    setErrors(nextErrorState)
  }

  return {
    formdata,
    setFormdata,
    errors,
    handleChange,
    setErrors
  }
}
export default useCheckboxForm
```

* This feature was inspired by the Domino's custom pizza builder in style and functionality. It was very tricky to manage the checkboxes UI and JSX, even with using the custom hook I wrote above.

I had to make sure that all of the datatypes were converted correctly from objects to arrays, to states, back to arrays, to strings, to numbers, etc...
```
categories.map(category => {
  return (
    <div key={category.id}>
      <label>{category.name} </label>
      <input 
        type="checkbox" 
        onChange={handleChange} 
        value={JSON.stringify(category)}
        checked={formdataCategories.some(object => object.name === category.name)}
      />
    </div>
  
  )
})
```

![Custom pie form](./client/src/images/custom-form.png)

![Custom pie submit button](./client/src/images/custom-submit.png)

* This was probably the most satisfying piece of code to write in the whole project after spending so much time wrangling the data to get manipulated by this form. I realised I had complete control over the the object that was added to the pies and baskets database and could change whatever I wanted at will!

```
const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  const unPopulatedCategories = formdata.categories.map(object => {
    return object.id
  })
  try {
    const { data } = await createPie({ ...formdata, name: `Custom ${formdata.name}`, price: `${formdata.price + 10}`, reviews: [], categories: unPopulatedCategories, image: 'https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/8391597635_2af90bd702.jpg' })
    handleAddToBasket(data)
  } catch (err) {
    setErrors(err.response.data.errors)
  }
}
```

## CHALLENGES OVERCOME
* We had some trouble figuring out how to store hashed passwords in our seeds data so we could create multiple users on seeding. We figured out we could create one user manually, dump the data into a seeds file, and then copy that hashed password for all users to start with.

```
"password": "pbkdf2_sha256$216000$RVlWaEcAABtL$UGP+lwcmVDE27T/XVnPCDFRG75CYIYGladDEvIvZxG0=",
"last_login": null,
"is_superuser": false,
"username": "charlotte",
"is_staff": false,
"is_active": true,
"date_joined": "2021-01-28T14:40:05.574Z",
"email": "charlotte@email.com",
```

![User login page](./client/src/images/login.png)

* We would often run into errors in the evening when we were working seperately on different features, but Slack was a huge help for communication and keeping track of errors for the next morning.

![Day 3 slack message](./client/src/images/day3.png)

## Key Learnings
For the category filters on the `Index.js` page, we initially tried to adapt code from another project my partner had worked on. However, this consumed a lot of time, and because we had set up our data and datatypes differently to the other project, this tactic proved to be more time spent than saved. The old code can be viewed in `PieCategories.js`. I ended up starting from scratch to use a much simpler filter function on the `pies` state that stored all of the pies data from a GET request.
```
const handleFilterPies = (event) => {
  const results = pies.filter(pie => {
    return pie.categories.includes(parseInt(event.target.id))
  })
  setPies(results)
}
```
And to clear the filters and display all pies again:
```
const handleClearFilter = async () => {
  const { data } = await getAllPies()
  setPies(data)
}
```
The takeaway for me was that it only makes sense to adapt existing code if it is similar enough to not need to write much. In this case, I spent much more time trying to untangle the old code than I eventually spent writing the new code.
